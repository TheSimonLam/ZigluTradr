### Afterthoughts

The test cases I'd write for this would be TDD.
I would use Jest and Enzyme to test React Components for their expected outputs/behaviors. Enzyme allows shallow and deep rendering of a React component with state and props whereas react-testing-library tests via. DOM giving us less control.

If the program were to get more complex, I'd opt for React Redux as a framework. React Context API has performance limitations wherein any component wrapped inside the provider would refresh.

As for error states, I would implement a global error logger. This may include an error toast popup describing to the user what's broken. I would also implement either BugSnag or Elastic RUM (Real User Monitoring) for Prod/Live bug reporting using source maps
